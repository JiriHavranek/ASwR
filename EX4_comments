We parallelized the functions randomForest (the one without specific mpy and the one with optimized mpy through cv). We ran both of them on 16 cores. Parallelization of the prediction functions and randomForest function in the body of CV did not speed up the process (adding more cores even slowed down the process).

We was able to speed up the process to roughly 18secs, i.e. we were able to halve the time. Very similar results are obtained when we choose not much different number of cores for the randomForest functions (e.g. 16,32 or 32,16 or 32,32)
